## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Answer: By describing the problem it solves, the benefits it offers and how it improves the user's life.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Answer: Highlighting unique features that differentiate your software from competitors such as innovative functionality, ease of use or superior performance makes your software outside
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Answer: Gathering data on the target market size, potential growth and change to understand the demand and opportunities for the software one is developing
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Answer: Market trends help in positioning one's software effectively and guiding development to meet current and future user needs.
